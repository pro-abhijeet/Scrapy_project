Using this knowledge, Google released Kubernetes as an free and open source project. Nowadays Kubernetes is used by small companies and big enterprises who want to gain the efficiency and velocity Google has. You can containerize applications using Docker. You can then run those containers on your servers, but there's no way you can manage those efficiently without extra management software. Kubernetes is an orchestrator for your containers that will create, schedule and manage your containers on a cluster of servers. Kubernetes can run on-premise or in the cloud, on a single machine or on thousands of machines. I will show you how to build apps in containers using docker and how to deploy those on a Kubernetes cluster. I will explain you how to setup your cluster on your desktop, or on the cloud using AWS.

Data repositories, such as relational and non-relational databases, data warehouses, data marts, data lakes, and big data stores process and store this data. Data Integration Platforms combine disparate data into a unified view for the data consumers. You will learn about each of these components in this course. You will also learn about Big Data and the use of some of the Big Data processing tools. A typical Data Engineering lifecycle includes architecting data platforms, designing data stores, and gathering, importing, wrangling, querying, and analyzing data. It also includes performance monitoring and finetuning to ensure systems are performing at optimal levels. In this course, you will learn about the data engineering lifecycle.

Although Google's Deep Learning library Tensorflow has gained massive popularity over the past few years, PyTorch has been the library of choice for professionals and researchers around the globe for deep learning and artificial intelligence. Is it possible that Tensorflow is popular only because Google is popular and used effective marketing? Why did Tensorflow change so significantly between version 1 and version 2? Was there something deeply flawed with it, and are there still potential problems? It is less well-known that PyTorch is backed by another Internet giant, Facebook (specifically, the Facebook AI Research Lab - FAIR). So if you want a popular deep learning library backed by billion dollar companies and lots of community support, you can't go wrong with PyTorch. And maybe it's a bonus that the library won't completely ruin all your old code when it advances to the next version. ;) On the flip side, it is very well-known that all the top AI shops (ex. OpenAI, Apple, and JPMorgan Chase) use PyTorch. OpenAI just recently switched to PyTorch in 2020, a strong sign that PyTorch is picking up steam.If you are a professional, you will quickly recognize that building and testing new ideas is extremely easy with PyTorch, while it can be pretty hard in other libraries that try to do everything for you.
