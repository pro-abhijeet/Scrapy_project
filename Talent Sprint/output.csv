Why is mastering Cyber Security critical in this new world? The COVID-19 outbreak has changed the cyber security threat landscape. There has been a surge in Work from Home, triggered by this pandemic. Our home networks are far more vulnerable than enterprise networks. As usual, cybercriminals are bound to exploit it. Since the beginning of the crisis, nearly 2000 malicious coronavirus-themed websites have been set up every day. The writing on the wall is clear. Even after the crisis, companies who have discovered value in the gig economy will continue to operate a significant part of their workforce from home. Hence the need for cyber security expertise becomes apparent. Is this the right time to pursue a Program in Cyber Security? If yes, how will completing this Program help in my career in cyber security?Amid COVID-19 crisis, new high-profile cyber attacks seem to constantly flood news headlines. No wonder the need for cyber security professionals is urgent and daunting.

India has reported a hike in attacks (on IoT deployments) by 22% in the country. Cyber security is one of the most in-demand skills, trending in the job market today.And studies point out that there will be nearly 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally by 2021. India alone has reported over 67,000 job openings. Companies are looking forward to professionals with an ability to build a viable cyber-resilient organization.

Is it too early to build this expertise? Gartner predicts that the business value of blockchain technology will reach $3 trillion by 2030. Industry reports suggest that in 2022 alone, the deployment of blockchain will be the heaviest among financial services, healthcare, information and communication. The announcement by the Finance Ministry of India for issuing the digital rupee by the RBI has added new growth prospects to the adoption of blockchain. However, the industry needs expert blockchain professionals to meet its deployment goals which has led to an upswing in their demand. Professionals who have built expertise in blockchain are already landing premium roles. For instance, a blockchain developer is paid 50% to 100% higher than a conventional developer. As per Glassdoor, a blockchain professional can command up to ₹20LPA depending on expertise, experience and industry.How Blockchain is Beyond Crypto? Blockchain enables the existence of cryptocurrency Many believe that the world of Blockchain is limited to cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin as it is an underlying technology for operating cryptocurrencies. However, in the last few years, the tech community has discovered potential applications of this ingenious technology, other than simply being a support system for cryptocurrency operations.Blockchain: a game-changer of the Indian economy Blockchain technology has generated significant interest across different industries in India like banking, finance, healthcare, supply chain, and others. One of the major factors, driving Blockchain technology adoption in the country is digitization. With demonetization impacting Indians since 2016, a wave of digital payments has swept in causing a huge shift in the way people transact: from physical currency to now digital payments (Paytm, GooglePay, etc.) Blockchain technology is emerging as one of the key innovations that will define the future of digital transactions in India. According to NASSCOM's Blockchain Report 2019, the adoption of blockchain technology in India is experiencing exponential growth as investments in blockchain-based projects have touched over $20 billion across multiple sectors. Blockchain beyond crypto: Uses of Blockchain across industries Banking and financial services players are predominantly deploying Blockchain for their operations. However, other industries are also catching up on the stream. Some of the Blockchain use-cases include:Finance &amp; Banking Trade Settlement: Faster transfer of securities and payments, reducing trading cost by removing intermediaries.Regulatory Compliance and Reporting: Store financial information eliminating errors associated with manual audit activities, reduce overall reporting costs.Healthcare and Life SciencesPatient Record Management using Blockchain to enable companies to simplify the safety of medical records and other activities. Supply ChainBlockchain enables the real-time tracking of a product in a supply chain thereby reducing the overall cost of moving items. Source: Deloitte Study What are the career opportunities in Blockchain?Experts peg Blockchain to be the hottest career in 2019 According to a study by Markets And Markets, the global Blockchain market size is poised to grow to US$ 7.6 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 79.6%. In India, the Blockchain market is expected to grow at a rate of 58% between 2018-24, driven by the boost of digital payments. With this growth, comes the opportunities for Blockchain experts in India and abroad. Blockchain is one of the most demanded professions on job sites with job growth rates at 2,000-6,000% and salary for a Blockchain developer at 50-100% higher than that of regular developer jobs. Experts peg the average annual remuneration for a full-time blockchain professional in India to be around INR 10-15 Lakhs at the entry-level which makes 30-50% higher than the average yearly pay of general software developers.

What are the top use cases of how Deep Learning/Data Science is useful in the healthcare industry? Digital Health and Imaging solutions are the biggest beneficiaries of Data Science, AI and Machine Learning. From saving lives to cutting down costs, data science has a huge role to play in the healthcare system. Take a look at some of the important use cases in healthcare.Improve Diagnostic Accuracy:According to the recent research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, about 5 percent of adult patients are misdiagnosed each year in the US continent that causes approximately 10 percent of patient deaths. Targeting this problem, a deep learning startup, Enlitic, built a deep learning algorithm that reads imaging data (such as x-rays, CT scans, etc.), and analyzes it, checks the given results against an extensive database of clinical reports and laboratory studies. This way the company could deliver up to 70 percent more accurate results, 50,000 times faster.Advanced pharmaceutical research to find cure for cancerBeing one of the most common and most deadly diseases, cancer has been a regular subject of scientific research. A Boston healthcare startup, BERG Health, reshapes the cancer medication market through extensive use of data science. Using powerful machine learning algorithms the company extracts and analyzes biological samples from over 1,000 patients in one go. The company has developed BPM 31510, the drug, that detects and triggers the natural death of cells damaged by the disease. Thus, the cancer cells can be removed from the human body naturally, without extensive medication and further damage to the patient’s health. While the drug is still being carefully tested, it gives us a clear understanding of the transformation potential that Data Science and deep technologies can provide to the pharmaceutical industry. Taking the risk out of prescription medicineMedAware, aims to eliminate prescription errors. The company claims that it has tools to help hospitals save up to $5.6 million, not to mention the reduced risk of lethal outcomes. A self-learning software system, provided by MedAware, checks all prescriptions against similar cases in the database and informs the doctor when the prescription contains any deviations from the typical treatment plan.Disease PreventionOmada Health is a digital therapeutics company that uses smart devices to create personalized behavior plans and online coaching to help prevent chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.And there are many such organizations who have opened up new opportunities using Data Science and Deep Learning for better healthcare. What are the career opportunities for participants in the digital health? Healthcare organizations are looking for professionals with Data Science and Deep Learning capabilities. With Data science and AI capabilities one could look into new career opportunities such as: Healthcare Data Analyst Advanced Analytics and Insights StrategistResearch Scientist, Health AIHealth Program Analyst Associate Scientist, Drug Product DevelopmentSenior Medical Imaging Software EngineerApart from new opportunities, this programme will help you take data driven decisions in current healthcare roles.

Many organisations are dipping their toes in new-age technologies by heavily investing in AI and Machine Learning. However, that does not mean they are reaping the value of deeptech within their organisations. The machine learning job market is projected to be worth $31 billion by 2024 – at an annual growth rate of 40 per cent over the last six years. As per studies, 90 % of all AI/ML models never make it into production. The reason is the lack of the right leadership to lead MLOps implementation, which is instrumental for the success of these projects. MLOps or Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) allows organisations to alleviate many of the issues on the path to AI with ROI and ensures your business derives the most value from your AI/ML investments. The PG Level Advanced Certification Programme in AI &amp; MLOps aims to help professionals build capabilities to lead new-age projects that are heavily dependent on AI/ML.

Tejeswini,  Project Engineer, Skyrus Engineering| ""Hands-on learning, tech support, experienced faculty, exposure to real-world problems - the right way to learn AI/ML for professionals."" Sai Kiran Gumma,  Vice President, JP Morgan Chase|Industry is clearly looking for professionals who can build AI/ML applications. Professionals with hands-on experience will be preferred by the industry.| This program is designed to reach higher levels of learning as per Bloom's Taxonomy. The program will not only help you Understand, but also enable you to Apply, Analyse and Evaluate which are far higher levels of expertise.| A participant will do 40+ individual lab experiments and 8 mini-hackathons. In addition they will also be participating in 4 hackathons, which includes select kaggle experiments. This will help the participant not only learn and implement AI/ML but also showcase your expertise for the industry to recognize.| Industry needs professionals with technical expertise and domain expertise to work together to solve today's challenges. Generally, domain expertise comes with experience, and tech expertise comes with young professionals.| As AI/ML has recently entered into the main-stage for companies and professionals, and the education system has very limited capacity for producing fresh graduates with AI/ML expertise, the industry is facing severe shortage. NASSCOM predicts that there are 140,000 vacancies while not even 30% of these seats are being fulfilled.|This has opened up great opportunities for working professionals. Those who are developing AI/ML expertise now are in great demand by the industry.| This demand will continue till the education system churns out enough good quality graduates with AI/ML expertise. The fact that the education system right from school is focusing on building AI/ML learning from a young age, and that many engineering institutions have launched focused programs like BTech in AI/ML, the supply will catch up with industry demand over the next 3-5 years.| This opens up a good window of opportunity for working professionals. If someone enters this area in the next 6 months to 1 year, they will have more than 2 year window to showcase their expertise and become the lead for the new generation that would come in.| Professionals are presented with a unique window of opportunity with AI/ML expertise. In the 1990s a large number of science graduates shifted to technology, and they are now defining the Technology sector. Similarly, those who enter the AI/ML area now will have a distinct advantage in the future of the industry.|Here's why this is the right time to invest in building your expertise:|Based on the data since lockdown, we find that serious professionals are using this time to get ready for the future.| Two things are happening as you wait and watch. 1) Younger and more dynamic professionals are going to enter with knowledge, 2) the experience premium will continue to drop thereby making senior professionals less attractive to companies. Hence, earlier one moves into sunrise areas will be better.| The LinkedIn Emerging Jobs Report lists AI as the #1 in the emerging jobs list for 2020.
